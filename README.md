# QSA Model - Question → Structure → Answer → Thought

## Summary

The QSA Model defines an explicit cognitive cycle for LLMs and AI systems:
- **Question (Q(x))**: Initiating inquiry.
- **Structure (S)**: Creating a structured intermediate representation.
- **Answer (A(x))**: Generating a response based on the structure.
- **Thought**: Reflecting and evolving to the next Question.

This model formalizes a recursive, self-evolving thought process based on human-initiated questioning, designed for operational use in AI systems.

## Priority Claim

This repository establishes the initial public release of the "QSA Model" concept as of `2025-04-27`.

The QSA Model is distinct from existing prompting techniques, agent frameworks, and cognitive models, offering a unified cycle designed for AI systems to evolve thoughts through structured inquiry.
