# Concept Overview

## Purpose
The QSA Model defines a structured cognitive cycle for LLMs and AI systems to recursively evolve thoughts based on human-initiated questioning. It formalizes inquiry-driven reasoning into a reproducible, extensible process.

## Core Cycle: Q(x) → S → A(x) → Thought
- **Q(x)**: A question or inquiry is initiated.
- **S**: A structured intermediate representation is created to organize possible approaches or frameworks to the question.
- **A(x)**: A generated answer is formulated based on the structured representation.
- **Thought**: Reflection on the answer occurs, producing a new insight or a next question, restarting the cycle.

## Key Features
- Human-initiated questioning at every cycle
- Explicit separation of structure creation (S) from answer generation (A(x))
- Recursive evolution of thought via subsequent questioning
- Designed for operational use by LLMs and autonomous AI agents
- Alignment with both philosophical inquiry models and practical AI reasoning workflows

## Intended Usage
The QSA Model is intended for:
- Enhancing autonomous reasoning agents
- Developing LLMs capable of deep, evolving inquiry
- Building systems for knowledge exploration and innovation

## Future Prospects
Potential extensions include:
- Self-regulated complexity scaling in structure building (adaptive S)
- Autonomous quality control over generated answers
- Integration into multi-agent systems for collaborative inquiry
