# Simple Loop Example

## Initial Question
"What factors contribute to the success of a startup?"

## Structure (S)
- Market need
- Team quality
- Timing
- Funding
- Product-market fit

## Answer (A(x))
"Product-market fit is often the most decisive factor among these, because it directly reflects whether the startup is solving a real problem in an effective way."

## Thought
"If product-market fit is decisive, what specific early signals indicate achieving it?"

## Next Cycle (optional)
New question:
"What early user behaviors most strongly predict product-market fit?"
